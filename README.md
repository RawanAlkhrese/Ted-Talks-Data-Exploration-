# Ted-Talks-Data-Exploration
## Prerequisites
- **Python versions 3.0+**
- **Pandas:** to read and clean the data.
- **Matplotlib:** to visulize the data.
## Project Motivation:
TED always amazes me of how their conference are organized and how one conference covers many topics from different fields. This project aims to answer some questions on TED Talks dataset from Kaggle. I will focus to answer these following questions: What are the top 10 most watched TED talks? , what is the most popular month for TED talks' events? and what is the average length of TED talk?
 ## About the Data:
[TED Talks dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/ted-talks) is used for this project. It contains information about conferences that recorded and uploaded to their official website TED.com. Information such as number of views and ratings, titles, name of speaker and descriptions.
