# Ted-Talks-Data-Exploration
## Prerequisites
- **Python versions 3.0+**
- **Pandas:** to read and clean the data.
- **Matplotlib:** to visulize the data.
## Project Motivation:
TED has been always amazed me of how their conferences are organized and how one conference can cover many topics from different fields. The main goal of this project is to apply my data science skills analyzing Ted Talks dataset from Kaggle and I will focus to find answers of these questions: 
- What are the top 10 most watched TED talks?
- What is the most popular month for TED talks' events?
- What is the average length of TED talk?
 ## About the Data:
[TED Talks dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/ted-talks) is used for this project. It contains information about conferences that recorded and uploaded to their official website TED.com. Information such as number of views and ratings, titles, name of speaker and descriptions.
## Results:
The main findings are explained [here](https://medium.com/@rawan.khurissi/data-exploration-on-ted-talks-dataset-from-kaggle-c40d68855615) 
 ## Files Descriptions:
 - **Ted-Talks-Data Exploration.ipynb:** contains the code of the project. 
 - **ted_mian.csv:** the dataset as csv file format.
